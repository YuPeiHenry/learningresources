# Introduction to C#

Author(s:) [Yu Pei, Henry](https://github.com/YuPeiHenry)

## What is C#

C# is an Object-Oriented Programming Language on the .NET framework, and uses Garbage Collection for memory management.

From Wikipedia:

C# (pronounced C sharp) is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.
It was developed around 2000 by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2018). C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.

## Why Learn C#

C# is a relatively high level language and is not difficult to pick up (a little more difficult than Python and a little easier than Java.)

### Cross platform support

C# is built on the .NET framework and has cross platform support extended by the (Mono project)[https://www.mono-project.com/], and similarly the complete runtime implementation from open source (CoreCL)[https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr].
C# is also used by the Unity Game Engine, which has high cross-platform support for game developers.

### Popular Language

From (Armina Mkhitaryan on Medium)[https://medium.com/sololearn/why-is-c-among-the-most-popular-programming-languages-in-the-world-ccf26824ffcb]

Being powerful, flexible, and well-supported has meant C# has quickly become one of the most popular programming languages available.
Today, it is the 4th most popular programming language, with approximately 31% of all developers using it regularly. It is also the 3rd largest community on StackOverflow (which was built using C#) with more than 1.1 million topics.

### Job demand and opportunities

From (Team Commerce on Mashable)[https://mashable.com/2018/03/17/coding-course-class-bootcamp/#om2xRzXFHGqJ]

Since it's such a robust and well-rounded language, it's no surprise that C# is utilized by thousands of companies. There are (5,000 C# jobs advertised in the US alone)[https://gooroo.io/analytics/skill/C-Sharp#.WqipapPwYWo]
(and 10,000 globally), with an (average base pay of nearly $80,000)[https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/c-net-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,15.htm].
